# Reactfire-post

This is just a simple React.js app which  gets the input from user and posts the data to firebase

In case you still wanna see the demo of this little creepy app, here you go:
```
git clone "https://github.com/harishankards/reactfire-post"
cd reactfire-post/
npm start 
```

Now go check here: `localost:3000`
